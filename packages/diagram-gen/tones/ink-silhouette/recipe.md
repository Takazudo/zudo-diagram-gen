# 03 Ink silhouette

Solid one-ink forms with reversed content and clear negative space.

This profile describes an original exploratory drawing. The linked external references informed broad construction principles; this SVG is not a copied brand asset. Project facts and design rules take precedence over its sample palette.

## Drawing recipe

- Construct the main objects as one-ink silhouettes with large clear negative spaces.
- Reverse labels or details out of the solid forms only where contrast remains strong.
- Use the same contour logic for all inputs and outputs; keep the composition visually balanced.
- Reduce internal decoration before reducing label size.
- Judge the solid drawing beside its actual help text because the black mass carries substantial visual weight.

## Useful placements

Compact spots and monochrome documentation.

## Size and theme notes

High visual weight competes with dense explanatory copy.

The original reference remains unchanged. New pack canvas: {{scheme:coordinateSystem.viewBox.2}} × {{scheme:coordinateSystem.viewBox.3}} user units. Labels: {{scheme:typography.label.fontSize}} and detail {{scheme:typography.detail.fontSize}}, minimum {{scheme:typography.label.minCssPx}} CSS pixels. Actual readability requires inspection.

`light.svg` and `dark.svg` are self-contained literal-color exports intended for an image element. `source.svg` retains theme variables and is an editable reference; changing its root `data-theme` selects the palette when the SVG's CSS is supported. Both exports retain editable text and geometry.

## Shared example meaning

A pattern background and a text layer combine into a composition that can be exported as an image. The example uses PNG as its export label. The shapes and sample typography are invented teaching material, not screenshots. Optional image layers and saving are omitted.

Read the bundled [composition meaning and glossary](../shared/composition-meaning.md) for the full input/output vocabulary and [provenance decisions](../shared/provenance.md) for reuse limits.

## Reading this drawing

Pattern and Text identify the two input layers. Aa is a lettering preview; MAKE SOMETHING is sample copy in their combined composition. PNG identifies the exported image. The connectors show that both inputs contribute to one result, not that text is transformed into a pattern.

## Optional public inspiration

These links explain broad visual construction principles. Reading them is optional; all example meaning is bundled locally.

## Native rollout pack

Authored from this tone’s local original construction: solid one-ink masses; reversed details and clear negative space. `scheme.json` is numeric authority; edit `kit.template.svg`, then run `node scripts/build-rollout-kits.mjs --tone ink-silhouette`. Production candidates use `materializeKit` with explicit themes and repeated instances. `composition.template.svg` plus `composition.instances.json` provides public test preparation, never user approval or automatic aesthetic certification.

### Required

- **native-construction**: Construct related objects with solid one-ink masses; reversed details and clear negative space. Preserve this geometry when remapping palette.
- **facts-and-labels**: Keep exact brief facts, counts and directions; separate empty, pending and complete. Inspect upright Japanese labels at actual placement.
- **semantic-palette**: Declare palette roles on every color-bearing mark. Ink carries readable content; surface is backing; border construction; accent emphasis; deep subordinate planes; warning explicitly labeled risk.

### Preferred

- **reading-hierarchy**: Keep labels outside small marks; use sparse subordinate geometry and generous negative space.

### Flexible

- **layout**: Change panel count, spacing, connectors and line breaks for the actual brief; this evidence composition is not a mandatory page template.
- **native-variation**: Author new silhouettes using this construction; explain intentional preferred-rule departures.
